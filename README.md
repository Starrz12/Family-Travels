# Family_Travels
## A site I built for fun to record places my family has been & places we plan to go.
This is the first site I built on my own while learning to use HTML & CSS.
I started with the main page & built a list of features I wanted the site to have.<br> 
Each page links to the others through a navigation menu at the top or an info bar along the bottom. <br>
<br>
**Pages Include**<br>
- Home Page: Travels planned for the rest of the current year
- Local "To Dos": A list of local fun activities, educational activities, outdoor activities, sports venues,  
- Far Away Destinations: Far away destinations we would like to visit
- Resources: Includes thumbnail images with embeded resource links to actual travel aid sites.
- Family favorites: This is my favorite page & one of the last I finished on this project. It includes "cards" lined up, each featuring a different local spot our family loves to visit. When clicked each image links to the website for that location so that anyone using the site can easily find more info & hopefully get to experience our favorites themselves. 
- Travel Tips: My top 10 travel tips for trips that are hours or weeks long <br>
<br>
This site has tons of potential to develop into a full blown travel recommendation site. 
I would love to redo this site some day with better user interactivity, a way for me to easily update information without hard coding the HTML, add a database to store a more complete set of info, & expand certain sections.
